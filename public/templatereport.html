Celebrities often have a large following and their endorsement can significantly increase a product&apos;s visibility and appeal. When a celebrity is seen using or endorsing a product, it can create a sense of trust and desirability among consumers. This marketing strategy taps into the influence celebrities have over public perception and buying habits. However, the success of this approach can vary depending on the celebrity&apos;s relevance to the target audience and the authenticity of the endorsement. Overall, it&apos;s a strong strategy but not without its considerations.<br /><br /><em>Specificity</em><br />Using a celebrity to market a kitchen sink in the United States can attract attention due to the celebrity&apos;s fame. However, the effectiveness of this strategy is limited because the decision to purchase a kitchen sink is primarily influenced by factors such as quality, functionality, design, and price rather than celebrity endorsement. Consumers may initially be drawn to the product because of the celebrity, but their final purchasing decision will likely be based on the product&apos;s merits and how well it meets their needs.<br /><br /><em>Risks</em><br /><ol><li>Supply chain disruptions: The risk is high due to potential delays in obtaining materials or components needed for kitchen sinks, which can be exacerbated by increased demand or limited supply.
