Most products are subject to standard consumer safety regulations which are fairly stable and do not regularly change radically. It is broadly a free market for selling items like sports equipment. Additionally, golf is a popular sport with a significant consumer base, making severe regulatory changes unlikely. High-impact legal changes would likely face pushback from consumer and industry groups, as well as potentially infringing on established principles of free trade and commerce. Therefore, the risk of negative impacts on companies selling golf clubs due to regulatory changes can be considered low.","score":0},"created":1709747969147}'
